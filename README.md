![Harmony = 6 + 7;](src/logo.png "Harmony - Fire in my eyes")

## Synopsis

The DataServices of ng-harmony-data allow not only for convenience methods,
but also suggest/imply certain automated listening/callback mechanisms to the
controller.
The component is a suchly integrated dynamic (data) controller

## Code Example

```javascript
```

## Motivation

* I wanted to be part of this because I liked it
* I am a secret agent and want to test my superpowers
* I had this idea ...
* I want to stick with Angular 1 for now and missed this feature

## Installation

I recommend the usage of jspm.
This way, just base your project upon jspm and start using this lib as in the code example above.

```bash
jspm i github:ng-harmony/...
```
